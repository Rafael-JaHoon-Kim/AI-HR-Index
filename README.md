# AI-HR-Index (Talent Stress Index)

## Abstract
This repository presents exploratory research on the relationship between organizational imbalances and workforce outcomes. Specifically, it investigates how **performance variance** and **advancement backlog** may influence turnover dynamics and the retention of high-performing employees. The study proposes a composite measure, the **Talent Stress Index (TSI)**, as an indicator of organizational stress. Using agent-based simulation, the project models alternative scenarios, such as reducing performance variance or backlog by targeted interventions, and compares their effects on retention trajectories.  

The contribution is twofold: first, it demonstrates how **AI-driven simulation and indexing** can provide early signals of organizational risk; second, it highlights the methodological potential of combining HR data with computational models to support both scholarly inquiry and practical decision-making. Importantly, the work is not intended to classify individuals but to reveal **system-level patterns** that inform discussions of organizational health and resilience.

## Research Objective
- To examine how **performance variance** and **advancement backlog** shape organizational outcomes such as **turnover** and **high-performer retention**.  
- To test whether composite indices (e.g., **Talent Stress Index, TSI**) can serve as reliable early-warning indicators.  
- To develop and validate **simulation-based approaches** (e.g., agent-based models) for exploring HR intervention strategies.

## Methodological Components
1. **Data Proxies**  
   - Performance distribution across teams  
   - Career progression backlog (promotion/advancement delays)  
   - Turnover data (with classification of high vs. non-high performers)  

2. **Index Construction**  
   - Talent Stress Index (TSI) = weighted function of performance variance and advancement backlog, including interaction effects  

3. **Simulation Models**  
   - Agent-based simulation of turnover and retention dynamics  
   - Scenario analysis (e.g., backlog reduction, redistribution of performance variance)  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Heatmaps of performanceâ€“backlog dynamics  
   - Retention curves under intervention scenarios

## Intended Contribution
- To propose a **data-driven framework** for analyzing systemic stress in organizations.  
- To contribute to academic scholarship on **strategic HR management**, **talent retention**, and **organizational resilience**.  
- To advance methodological practice by applying **AI and computational simulations** to HR research.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for **research and educational purposes only**.  
All indices and simulations are exploratory and should not be used for individual-level evaluation.  
The primary aim is to encourage dialogue on **organizational health, risk management, and evidence-based HR strategy**.
